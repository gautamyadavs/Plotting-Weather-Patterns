# Plotting-Weather-Patterns-in-Kanpur

Python code which returns a line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014. 
The area between the record high and record low temperatures for each day is shaded.
A scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015.
Removing leap days (i.e. February 29th) as it is reasonable to remove these points from the dataset for the purpose of this visualization.
