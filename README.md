The data is read from csv file available as open source from Indian government.<BR>

Python code which returns a line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014.<BR>
The area between the record high and record low temperatures for each day is shaded.<BR>
A scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015.<BR>
Removing leap days (i.e. February 29th) as it is reasonable to remove these points from the dataset for the purpose of this visualization.<BR>
